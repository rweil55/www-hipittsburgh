<h2 ALIGN="CENTER">CYCLING WEEKEND AT WILDERNESS LODGE</h2>
<h3 ALIGN="CENTER">October 4-6, 1996</h3>
<p>The August 2-4 trip to Erie County was so successful that there was a return.
Summer and fall weekends at Wilderness Lodge will
be added to the tradition already established by our cross-country skiers. 
Those who have been there can attest to the comfort and relaxing ambiance of the
Lodge and to the excellence of Nansi Janes' cooking. 
</p>
<p>Don Hutchinson of North East, PA, who volunteered his knowledge of the area
during the August trip, has offered to map out a route through farms and
vineyards along the shore of Lake Erie, securing permission from the local
growers. </p>
<p>Other riding options available to you were: (1) touring the relatively flat
macadam roads in the scenic environs of Peek 'n' Peak and French Creek, where
you will find a classic General Store stocked with everything from Woolrich to
ice cream;  the French Creek Tavern features a famous Friday Night Fish Fry;
also worth noting is Peek 'n' Peak's offer of the use of its pool, sauna, and
fitness center to the general public for a fee of $5.00; (2) The Lake Erie
Shoreline Tour including a stop at the Heritage Winery and a rest stop at
Orchard Beach in Freeport where you can wade along the shore; (3) a ride on
Presque Isle, using both the paved bike trail and the park roads. NOTE: Except
for Presque Isle, mountain bikes or hybrid bicycles were recommended. Helmets were
REQUIRED on all rides.   
</p>
<p>COST: $55 per person for AYH members, $65 for non-members for a bed in a
hostel-style room (3-6 persons). There were three private double rooms, two
persons per room at $130 for AYH members, $150 for non-members. The cost
includes Friday and Saturday night lodging and a family style dinner Saturday
evening.  Vegetarian meals were available upon request. Transportation cost is
not included. 
</p>
<p>Reserve early by calling the AYH Office at 412-422-2282; space was limited to
36 people. Send a check for the full amount payable to Pittsburgh AYH a.s.a.p.
after your call to guarantee your space. A waiting list will be kept. Fees
include a non-refundable $10 per person, or $20 per double room.
