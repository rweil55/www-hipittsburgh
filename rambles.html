<h2>
 Rambles</h2>
<p><a NAME="WHAT"></a><b>&quot;Rambles&quot;</b> were casual Wednesday outings sponsored
by the <a href="/index.html">Pittsburgh Council</a>
of Hostelling International - American Youth Hostels. Most take place in
and around the city of Pittsburgh.
<p>The group meets at 10 a.m. (<i>9:30 am during the summer)</i> in the
upper parking lot of Mellon Park in Shadyside, off Shady Avenue near the
intersection with Fifth Avenue. Remember to bring quarters for the parking
meters.
<p>Trips were normally three to four miles in length, at a leisurely pace.
Trips were always subject to change because of weather, conflicts of schedule,
and the choice of the group. We do plan to walk in all kinds of weather,
so please dress appropriately.
<p>From time to time, we will schedule lunch at a restaurant or a brown
bag lunch. These were optional.
<p>We also try to carpool to save energy and to enjoy each other's company.
For trips over 10 miles, please pay the driver $2 per passenger.
<p>The trips listed below were a sample of the type of trips that were
&quot;rambles&quot;.
<p>Check the latest <a href="newsletter/index.htm">newsletter</a> for the current trip
schedule and leader.
<p>Call the leader listed for information about a trip or to
inform the leader that you plan to walk with the group (especially when
reservations were requested or you plan to meet us at the trail head), but
please call before 10 o'clock at night.
<p>Last years schedule to give a feel of the type of rambles.
