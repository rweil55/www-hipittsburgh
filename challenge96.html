<h2>The Saga of the Rachel Carson Trail Challenge 1996&nbsp;</h2>

<h3>...AND THEN THERE WERE FIVE</h3>

<p>I was getting 18 calls a day from people who were hooked on the idea
of hiking &quot;34 miles in one day&quot;--the 1996 Rachel Carson Trail
Challenge. So was Leo (Stember). Leo and I were the co-organizers of this
first-ever event. Having hiked the distance, not in one day, on the RCT,
I had a sense of how difficult it might be to do the entire trail in a
single day. Leo did 17 miles in one day to check out blazing and blowdowns
along the first half. He knew.</p>

<p>Yet a lot of my calls were from people who had credentials: &quot;I
ran the 70-mile Laurel Ridge Run&quot;; &quot;Last year, I hiked 26 miles
in one day&quot;; &quot;I'm a marathon runner; I knock off 26 miles, running,
before breakfast&quot;; &quot;I did the Laurel Highlands Trail in 3 days--26
miles the first day&quot;. I was beginning to imagine that maybe, just
maybe, we might have a whole mob of people finishing the endurance trial
on the trail before sunset on June 22, high above the Allegheny River in
Harrison Hills. Yet, ... </p>

<p>At first, Leo and I thought we might get 50 registrants for all three
events: the 34-mile Challenge, the 17-mile Half-Challenge (ending at the
Rachel Carson Homestead in Springdale), and the 5-mile Family Challenge.
Since Bob Batz wrote a little piece for the Post-Gazette, however, we were
getting swamped with calls, and there was no end in sight. We had set a
nominal limit of 100 participants for the Half and Full Challenges but
we quickly exceeded 100 applications. </p>

<p>In the end, we had 90 sign-ups for the Challenge, 31 for the Half-Challenge,
and 14 for the Family Challenge. And some of these people had credentials.
It was scary. We had offered all finishers a weekend for two at the Ohiopyle
Youth Hostel, a special finisher's t-shirt, a Rachel Carson Trail embroidered
patch, a year's subscription to the Rachel Carson Homestead newsletter,
and a year's subscription to the AYH Golden Triangle. Our logistical arrangements,
volunteer marshals, police, county park officials, insurance certification,
were all being strained to our meager limit. We might have to sell the
farm. </p>

<p>In the morning darkness and dampness of June 22, I showed up at the
North Park Beaver Shelter and was not too surprised to find nearly 25 cars
all lined up in the parking area on Babcock Boulevard, hikers all. I was
getting used to this. We unloaded our Trip Lists, our t-shirts, Leo came
with the Clif Bars, graciously donated by the Clif Bar company and by Eastern
Mountain Sports in South Hills Village, a few more volunteers came, we
checked the folks in, gave a 5-minute orientation (stay on the trail! improvise!
hydrate or die! don't get sick! respect private property! etc.) and sent
them off into the darkness. </p>

<p>The first challenge, of course, was just getting on the Trail, crossing
the collapsed causeway over to the trailhead across the little pond next
to Beaver Shelter. This involved a quick scramble down and up the washout.
I once glanced across the pond long enough to see about a dozen hikers
making the wrong turn on the other side, going to the right and not the
left. I winced as I pictured them showing up at the North Park skating
rink an hour later. </p>

<p>Everyone got on the Trail quickly, out by 6:15 AM; at 6:30 AM Nancy
Able and I posted ourselves at the Route 8 crossing, and waiting for the
first hikers to come through so we could assist them in crossing the highway.
At 6:52, John DeWalt, a Laurel Highlands Ridge Runner, came crashing through
the bushes, running, no less, greeted us with a smile and continued on.
Nine minutes later, Alan Aliskovitz, an active Sierra Club hike and backpacking
leader, came likewise crashing through the bushes asking &quot;How long
ago did HE go by here?&quot; referring to John. </p>

<p>Then there was a pause of nearly half an hour before any appreciable
number of hikers came out to Route 8, approximately 4 miles from the start.
Apparently, many wrong turns and false trails had introduced many of our
hikers to the more subtle challenge: staying on the trail. The two mile
per hour minimum progress rule seemed generous until one experienced how
scouting for a lost trail ate up your time. As the main body (pelaton)
came through, Nancy and I were ably (no pun intended) assisted by two Hampton
Township police officers who held back the early morning traffic rushing
past our crossing. </p>

<p>The first real checkpoint was on Shaffer Road, 7 miles into the hike,
and was staffed by Marianne Kasica, AYH President, Jim Christ (look for
his view of the Challenge, elsewhere in this issue), Jim's son Ross, Vince
Roolf, Sue and Jim Ritchie, and Leo. John DeWalt came through, running.
Ninety more hikers passed by. At this point, a the hikers' legs revealed
some splashes of mud here and there, foretelling the reputation of the
RCT as the &quot;muddy, bloody, Rachel Carson Trail&quot;. And, it was
getting hot, and humid, too. </p>

<p>The next checkpoint, Mile 10 at Emmerling Park, saw hikers who had just
experienced a couple of the RCT's roller coaster gas pipeline hills. No
one dropped out between Shafer Road and Emmerling Park. They were doing
OK. Eighty-five year old Jim Kratt, who helped maintain the trail 15 years
ago, made it to Mile 10 before his knee gave out. He called his son to
come out and pick him up. Emmerling was staffed by Patty Scheuering, her
daughter Susan, and two of Susan's friends, offering not much more than
water and sympathy. If the hikers knew what lie ahead..., and it was getting
hotter. </p>

<p>The steep climb at Mile 12, from Long Run at the bottom to Rich Hill
Road at the top was a spirit breaker; reality was beginning to set in--this
was going to be a long, tough hike, even if you could find the trail. Rich
Hill is so steep your nose almost rubs the slope in front of you as you
climb. Each time you crest the &quot;top&quot; another &quot;top&quot;
appears, 100 more yards away. After that, a short stretch of &quot;flat&quot;
and then a steep downhill to a checkpoint at Russellton Road. Downhills
hurt too. </p>

<p>Right after Russellton Road, the still bigger hill on Mile 14 followed.
If Rich Hill didn't break your spirit, Mile 14 might just do the trick.
I watched the now muddied-and-bloodied hikers snake their way steeply up
to the first false summit, legs burning, lungs busting, sensing the vapors
of grim determination of our hikers on Mile 14. The sun was burning down,
reaching its high of 90 degrees with humidity approaching 70 percent, and
a borderline ozone day to boot (no pun intended). Joe Hoechner and Tim
Henigin staffed Russellton Road, graciously providing a canopy to get under
for relief from the sun's glare. </p>

<p>Down Yutes Run Road, past Peterson's Nursery, and then you hit the &quot;roller
coaster&quot; going into Springdale's Melzina Road checkpoint. Up, down,
up, down, up, down; steep and high, brambles, high grass, heat, sun, humidity.
I arrived at Melzina just two minutes ahead of John DeWalt, Leo about 1
minute behind me. John came crashing and stumbling up out of the high grass,
soaking wet (he had thrown himself into a creek to cool off), and semi-delirious
with exhaustion (he was still running). Seventy-five hikers followed John
past Melzina Road. Melzina was staffed by Springdale native Heather Schweitzer
and her two friends. </p>

<p>At Melzina, many of the hikers, mercifully, called it a day. We had
a bad break with the heat: it wore a lot of people down more quickly than
what could been. Many went to the Rachel Carson Homestead, half a mile
away, and called for a ride home, sitting in the cool shade once enjoyed
by Rachel, herself, while we, many of us only children, played &quot;hike&quot;
with our friends. Many called for a ride right at Melzina, using cell phones
made available to us by Bell Atlantic/NyNex for the Challenge. The cell
phones were a godsend, allowing all the marshals to keep in touch with
each other, and to pinpoint the location of hikers being sought by wives,
husbands, mothers and friends. </p>

<p>Mark Tomlinson, the recently named Executive Director of the Rachel
Carson Homestead, was also a godsend, allowing us to stage our halfway
mark on the Homestead grounds. Mark has indicated that, over the next year,
he will develop a better link of the Trail with the Homestead, and provide
some signage so hikers can find the Homestead more easily and Homestead
visitors can likewise find the Trail. </p>

<p>Somehow, many hikers continued, to Springdale Hollow Road, up the power
line to the bluffs above the Allegheny River, into the cool, cool woods
on high. But the Trail was tough in there, poorly marked, tricky, turning
abruptly onto and off the power line. Only 31 hikers checked into the Sheetz
at Mile 20, and only 11 went beyond, to even more brutally steep hills
climbing power lines and pipelines, false summits, weeds, blowdowns, washouts,
lost trail, mud and blood, past Bailey's Run. Gerry Vaerywick and Gene
Pochapsky finally bailed out at Bailey's Run (no pun intended); Only 9
hikers made it to the last checkpoint at St. Clemens Cemetery. Barb Peterson,
Dana Overmyer, Boris Bartlog, and Joe Seiler called it quits at St. Clemen's--still
on the Trail but they ran out of time with no way to finish on time due
to a last minute loss of the trail between Bailey's Run and Saxonburg Roads.
Ultimately only 5 would finish. </p>

<p>John DeWalt was outstripping our support system, arriving at checkpoints
before they were set up. In order to provide water, Leo had to calculate
John's ETA at future checkpoints and make a special trip out there to catch
John as he passed by. Near Bailey's Run, John apologized, saying &quot;I
just can't run up those hills anymore, just on the flats&quot;. And even
later, John quit running altogether, saying this might be the hardest effort
he's ever made in any event. </p>

<p>John DeWalt finished a little after 6 PM, cleaned himself up a little,
and then relaxed and schmoozed on the grass at Harrison Hills while only
4 more hikers remained on the Trail. Alan Aliskovitz, Erin Abraham, Mike
Blackwell, and Eric Filo had passed through St.Clemens at 5:20 PM with
8 miles to go before 8:54 PM. At about 8:30 PM, I began backtracking on
the Trail to see if they were on their way; in only a couple of minutes
I found them by the entrance to the park, tired, but in good spirits, and
determined to make the finish. They came into the finish area just as the
alpenglow faded from the clouds and the sun dropped below the horizon.
Erin, with no compromise to the day, did three cartwheels across the grass
as she came in. So the five finishers were all there, hobbling maybe just
a little. The first thing the hikers did when they got in: took off their
boots. Patty S. went for pizza and we all ate pizza, we took a few photos,
did congratulations, and made sure everyone got out of the park by 9:30
PM--our deal with the park police. </p>

<p>What good came out of this? Well, the Rachel Carson Trail, a trail struggling
for existence, got a lot of feet on it, something it desperately needed
to preserve its trace across the northern suburbs of Allegheny County.
The publicity will no doubt put more hikers on the Trail over the next
year than, perhaps, it's seen in the past 5 years. And, we'll get a few
Trail Maintenance volunteers who will adopt a 2-3 mile section and take
care of it: blazing, trimming, and keeping it clean and viable. The hikers
made friends, formed teams right on the trail, and faced the challenges
together, many attempting and completing a feat that may well be the hardest
thing they've ever done in their life, even if only to the Half-Challenge
point. </p>

<p>Some learned the importance of working as a team, saying it was the
team that got them as far as they went: urging them on when they wanted
to quit, making them laugh when they hurt, finding the trail when they
could not. You did, indeed, need to use all your resources to do this:
your map, the blazes, your trip list, and perhaps most importantly, the
others you met on the trail. </p>

<p>Leo and I have already heard about next year: &quot;All the marathon
people and the Ridge Runners will be here next year&quot;; &quot;I'm going
to 'train' so I know where the Trail goes, next time&quot;; &quot;I had
no idea it would be this hard...next time I'll know and I'll be ready for
it&quot;.</p>
