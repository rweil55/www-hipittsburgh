<h2>

<a NAME="Start"></a>Starting Point</h2>

The MVC will start in Elizabeth from the dance studio. Elizabeth is south

of Pittsburgh on Route 51 just after it crosses the Monongahela River.

Take the first exit on the right after crossing the bridge and follow the

signs to registration. Registration opens at 6:30 am. These starting times

are recommended so you will not be too early or late for any of the rest

stops.

<ul>

<li>

100 and 70 miles: 6:30 am -- 8:00 am</li>



<li>

50 and 30 miles: 8:00 am -- 11:00 am</li>

</ul>

<h2>

<a NAME="Route"></a>Route</h2>

Large sections of each ride follow the Monongahela River. The scenery varies

from industrial towns to spectacular views of the river and wooded hillsides.

You will have a choice of 100 miles, 70 miles, 50 miles or 30 miles. The

100 and 70 mile routes are composed of equal portions of hilly, rolling,

and flat terrain. The most challenging climb occurs just out of Brownsville

and is nearly two miles long. (The other hills are gentler). The 50 and

30 mile rides are flat to gently rolling, with the exception of one hill

near the locks south of Elizabeth, and are well suited for intermediate

and beginner riders. All routes will also be marked with arrows on the

pavement where practical.

<h2>

<a NAME="Food"></a>Food</h2>

A wonderful fix-your-own sandwich lunch stop was included for all riders

at a park along the Mon River. 70 milers receive one additional snack stop

and Century riders receive 2 snacks in addition to lunch. There are also

many convenience stores along the route.

<h2>

<a NAME="Support"></a>Support</h2>

A sag will pick up those who can't finish due to bike problems or fatigue.

You and your bike are expected to be in good shape before the ride starts.

If you're not sure about the condition of your bike, please take it to

your local bike shop for a safety check. While you're there, pick up a

spare tube and carry it on the ride.

<h2>

<a NAME="T-Shirt"></a>T-Shirts</h2>

The Mon Valley Century T-Shirt was only $8. However, only riders who prepay

for a T-shirt with their registration by August 12th will be guaranteed

to receive an MVC shirt. There will be a limited number of shirts for sale

on the ride day (mostly L and XL).

bicycle helmet on all our cycling rides. Look for helmets meeting ANSI

<h2>

<a NAME="Proceeds"></a>Proceeds</h2>

Proceeds from MVC benefited the former Pittsburgh International Hostel on Warrington  Fund and were being used

to support the <a href="http://hipittsburgh.org/pittsburgh_hostel.html"> Hostel</a> in the Allentown section of Pittsburgh. The hostel

opened June 5, 1967 and had hosted over <b>ten thousand</b> visitors from

all around the world.&nbsp; A portion of the proceeds will also benefit the Monesson Amateur Radio Club, our long time partner in the MVC. The entire

amount of any additional contributions beyond the cost of the ride will

go to the hostel fund and will be greatly appreciated.
