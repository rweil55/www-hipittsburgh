<p>We were located above the Southside at 830 East
Warrington Avenue at the corner with Arlington, in Pittsburgh's Allentown
neighborhood. There is <a href="../pgh_map.html">map</a> that shows the location,
along with <a href="../pgh_direct.htm">textual directions</a>.&nbsp; Southside
is on the south shore of the Monongahela River across from downtown Pittsburgh.
