<p>The sky was blue; the air was cool; the trail was clean; the water was low.
spirits were high. That pretty much sums up RCTC &#146;99. A grand total of 195
entries put 390 feet on the Rachel Carson Trail tread way on June 19, 1999.
Seventy-four (74) athletes ran, walked, climbed, scooted, and stumbled their way
through the 33.24 miles from the Beaver Shelter in North Park to the Ox Roast
Shelter in Harrison Hills Park. The first finisher, Frank Eyth, of Pittsburgh,
ambled into Harrison Hills at 12:50 pm, so early no one was there to greet him.
By the time the support services got there, he had gone home and left a note
with a party of picnickers at the nearby Ox Roast Shelter. So good were
conditions, and so primed were the athletes that the second finisher, John
DeWalt, of Sarver, PA, knocked nearly two hours off his personal best finish at
3:30 PM in 1997 finishing at 1:35 PM, and newcomer Stephen Downing, of
Sewickley, was only a short distance behind, finishing at 2:10 PM.</p>

<p>The best weather day of the year greeted the Challengers at they checked in
at 5:30 AM to get their shirts, maps, and 3-minute orientation before striking
out across the causeway to the Rachel Carson Trail. The high temp for the day
was 74 degrees; when the sun approached mid afternoon, the clouds coolly complied
by filling the sky, filtering the sunlight into mellow warmth.</p>
<p>The hikers were supposed to hit the Route 8 crossing by 7:10 am; we had
carefully calculated the times the fastest hikers would hit each key point along
the Trail. By the time Cele and I got there to direct traffic and provide a safe
crossing, dozens of hikers were streaming out of the woods and out across the
highway, unattended. They were way ahead of schedule. I called Leo (Stember,
co-organizer) and said &quot;You&#146;d better set up Shaffer Road early because
they&#146;re going to outrun our checkpoints&quot;.</p>
<p>At Shaffer Road, the runners&#146; vanguard, led by John DeWalt, Frank Eyth, and
Stephen Downing were coming into sight as the very first marshal began to set
up. Within minutes, dozens more were coming in, looking great actually, cool,
relaxed, dry; having a good day. Personal Bests were going to be the order of
the day. Sylvia gave out bandages for blister, Jim Crist and daughter Emma
provided the entertainment at CP1 (Check Point 1) with Emma quizzing hikers on
who they voted for for president, their favorite color, movie, song, etc. Frank,
whose granddaughter was running the Challenge, steered hikers to the checklist;
Jim Crist made sure they had checked in before they left.</p>
<p>As the day went on, the pace picked up. Many hikers were actually picking up
steam as they headed down the Trail, starting off slow from North Park to Shafer
and building up speed as they progressed. Past Casey&#146;s, where Marshal Vince
made sure the hikers stayed on track along the entrance road and back through
the equipment yard.</p>
<p>At Emmerling Park, Marshals Patti and Steve directed the Challengers to water
and restrooms, their last before hitting the first big Rachel Carson Hill, Rich
Hill by name, a half-mile long climb, so steep at the bottom you can reach out
and touch the dirt in front of your face as you rise up its face. I stood at the
top of Rich Hill to congratulate hikers as they made it to the top, offering
water and sympathy.</p>
<p>Soon, as they jammed their toes into the front of their hiking boots and
running shoes going down LaFever Hill, they could look ahead past CP2 and see
the hill known as &quot;Mile 14&quot;. Nearly a mile long itself, Mile 14 seems
to stretch to the sky; tiny hikers off in the distance, strung out like sparse
beads on a cheap necklace were scattered in a mile-long chain. Marshals Jack and
Blanche, at the bottom of the hill, gave out water, snacks, and friendly advice.</p>
<p>Next came the turnoff to the Rachel Carson Homestead in Springdale with marshals
Vince and Hugh taking turns directing traffic on the pipeline at the end
of the Roller Coaster. The Roller Coaster consists of five sharp hills, all in a
row, in track no more than one mile long. One young woman, sitting by the
turnoff for awhile contemplating her fate, decided to give it a go and headed on
down the trail, rejecting the temptation to quit and rest, to eat, drink, get a
massage, and be merry, instead choosing to challenge the dreaded unknown ahead.
Five minutes later, she came back in, giving it up, today anyway, and headed for
the crowd of 75 participants who pounded out the 17 mile trek to Rachel&#146;s
House.</p>
<p>Next stop was Sheetz where Marshals Patti and Steve reappeared, with a
shelter set up to block the sun that barely peeped through the cloud cover. CP3,
however, was in full view of Crawford&#146;s Hill, a power line right-of-way
rocketing out of the valley below, 300 feet to a crest overlooking the distant
Allegheny River and New Kensington. The mild sun, the low streams, the gentle
breeze, and wonderful trail conditions were no match for Challengers &#145;99.
Nearly everyone who got to Sheetz managed, ultimately, to finish at Harrison
Hills.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Leo was missing the leaders at nearly every checkpoint. It
was Leo&#146;s job to open up the checkpoints and get the Marshals in place with
water, snacks, checklists, and instructions. Getting to Springdale Hollow/Riddle
Run Road just in time to see them disappear over the top of the hill, he sped to
the next road crossing hoping to intercept. Soon they came and Leo was able to
water and feed the leaders.</p>
<p>We tried to intimidate the hikers by placing CP4 at the very bottom and edge
of Burtner Hill, with perhaps the steepest rise of the entire trail at their
fingertips. Even that, however, was not able to turn back a single hiker.
Everyone who passed CP4 made it to the end, with time to spare.</p>
<p>The best parts of every Challenge are the stories shared at the end of the
day, stories of heroism and cowardice, comedy and tragedy, elation and
disappointment, strategy and blunder, the struggles and the insights of the
human animal testing its limits. In one story, a guy and a gal are hiking, past
the Homestead, past Sheetz, approaching Burtner. He keeps asking her if she&#146;s
OK and tells her if she wants to, they can quit, it&#146;s OK, he doesn&#146;t want
her to be miserable. All the while, he&#146;s secretly hoping she says &quot;OK, I&#146;ve
had enough&quot;. But, she never says it, she just keeps on going. He&#146;s
getting pretty pooped and begins to be just a little concerned that HE will make
it. In the end, they both make it, but he&#146;s just a little worse for the wear
and tear.</p>
<p>Another two guys had reached the Homestead and left the Trail to get some
water and food and contemplate continuation. While their, they decided to get
the free massage being offered their by Bob Rock, Martha Braun, and company from
Allegheny Advanced Medicine. AAM must know what it&#146;s doing, because after the
massage these guys couldn&#146;t believe how good they felt, just like they felt at
5:30 in the morning at the start, as good as new. So, they jumped back onto the
trail and finished at Harrison Hills with nearly an hour to spare.</p>
<p>As an aside, the folks form AAM gave more than 60 massages to hikers who
either finished or stopped into the Rachel Carson Homestead for a break.
Homestead Director Mark Tomlinson had food and drink on hand as well as
telephones and toilets for those coming in off the Trail.</p>
<p>At Harrison Hills, Leo and I were monitoring all the hikers out on the Trail.
Using the Check Point sheets, they could tell who was still out, who had quit,
and what time anyone had gone past the CP. One couple, Bob and Lisa, were the
only two people unaccounted for: they had passed Sheetz, CP3, but hours later,
they had never reached Burtner, CP4. CP4 shut down at 7 pm. What would happen it
they had been lost and came in 15 minutes later? 8 PM-no word. 8:30 PM-still no
word. We kept asking other hikers coming in to the Park if they&#146;d seen anyone
behind them. &quot;No&quot;. Finally, in desperation, and on a hunch, I called
Bob at home. No answer. Then Lisa. &quot;Hello&quot;. They had &quot;bailed
out&quot; at Bailey&#146;s Run, in spite of the pun. All accounted for.</p>
<p>As the last rays of the sun were being snuffed out on the western horizon,
and Leo and I were packing up our gear to make our forced exit from Harrison
Hills Park, one of the Challengers came up to me and thanked me and all of us
for the work we had put into the event, saying &quot;You know, I had to prove
something to myself, and you gave me the opportunity to do that. Thanks, It is
appreciated.&quot;</p>
<p>Sometimes when you&#146;re pushing your limits and you&#146;re really tired, your
mind has a hard time keeping in focus. One of the leaders got to within a half
mile of the end of the hike, and couldn&#146;t locate a turn. He looked and looked
and walked back and forth and up and down and just couldn&#146;t see it. After
nearly 20 minutes of tracking and backtracking and retracking he found the turn
and in 10 more minutes finished the hike. Oddly, the blaze at that turn was, in
fact, in full view, and no one else mentioned having a problem at that point.</p>
<p>At the little dirt slide coming down into CP4 at Burtner Hill, our Trail
Photographer, Jim Ritchie, Jr., was laying in the weeds waiting to get some
action shots of hikers scooting down the slide to the edge of the small creek.
After a couple of minutes, 3 hikers appeared at the crest of the slide and began
to assume the scooting position, butt to dirt, to get down the slide without
breaking a leg. As soon as they saw the photographer, however, they had to do
the macho thing, and quickly bolting to their feet, ran down the slide, standing
upright, hell bent for leather, nearly going down face first at the bottom.</p>
<p>Dwight Fox of Aspinwall, a Baker Trail volunteer, earned the nickname
&quot;Mr. Clean&quot; as he came strolling into Harrison Hills at 5:35 PM
looking like he had spent the afternoon at Monroeville Mall, no sweaty clothing
and hardly a single speckle of mud on his pants. Gino Santucci came in at 7:35
PM wearing a pair of shorts and carrying nothing else except a fanny pack hardly
big enough to carry his car keys and a single water bottle. Leo dubbed him the
&quot;minimalist&quot;.</p>
<p>As Stan Schiffman approached the cutoff to the Rachel Carson Homestead, he
had not seen anyone behind him for a long, long, time. He expected that he was
probably running dead last. On the &quot;roller coaster&quot;, less than a mile
to go, he could see two people up ahead-they were hitting the peaks of the
coaster just as he was. Then, they went into a dip on the roller coaster and he
never saw them again. When he got to the cut off, and asked Marshal Hugh what
happened, Hugh said he saw them go down and he never saw them again either. They
never came back up. So Stan went in to the Homestead and 45 minutes later, here
they come, straggling in. Evidently they had cut over onto a side street and
wandered the streets of Springdale, looking for the Homestead, allowing Stan the
satisfaction of coming in ahead of someone-anyone.</p>
<p>Dave Schramm, came in to register at North Park with his two boys, Jordan and
Ben, only minutes before we pulled up stakes and headed for CP1. They got their
t-shirts and bananas and headed out across the causeway to the Trail. About 7 or
8 minutes later, as we finished up packing our supplies, I thought I heard
something in the direction of the Trail, so I glanced over to see what was going
on. There was one of Dave&#146;s boys skipping stones across the pond from the edge
of the causeway. Obviously, they were here for the pleasure of a day in the
woods and on the Trail without regard to making high mileage.</p>
<p>The Rumons, 3 girls with Dad, at Mile 14 whispered to one of the Marshals
that they wanted to quit. And they looked pretty bushed. When one of the CP
Marshals asked if they wanted a ride, they said no, they had an obsessed dad who
was going to force them to make it to the Homestead, and they had to make him
happy. At the Homestead, the girls stopped out while Dad went on to finish at
6:50 PM in Harrison Hills. Congrats, Dave!</p>
<p>How many people saw the guy who was just in North Park taking a walk at 5:30
in the morning, saw all the hikers going by and decided to follow them; 2 hours
later he&#146;s at the Shaffer Road Checkpoint using his cell phone trying to tell
his wife where he is; problem is he doesn&#146;t know himself. I saw him crossing
Route 8 looking up at the sky like &quot;Where am I? What am I doing here?&quot;
I assume he eventually got home OK.</p>
<p>Did you know Elizabeth Taylor was one of our Challengers? No lie! She made
the Homestead at 3:40 PM. Good job, Liz!</p>
<p>Barb Peterson was thrilled with her time, finishing at 4:35 PM, knocking
hours off her 1997 finish. She just keeps getting better, year after year. There
were only 5 two-time finishers competing in 1999: Barb, Don Erdeljac, Pat Goebl,
John Havel, and Tom Bevan. Don&#146;s our Rachel Carson Trail maintenance volunteer
extraordinaire, Pat is part of team EMS, and John and Tom came out for the
&quot;May Hikes&quot; this year; those are the four &quot;training hikes&quot;
we do on 2 consecutive weekends in May to give people an opportunity to train
physically, but also to learn the &quot;look and feel&quot; of the Rachel Carson
Trail. Then, of course, we have our one and only one 3-time finisher, John
DeWalt of Sarver. John, too, keeps getting better and better, finishing this
year at 1:35 PM.</p>
<p>The men who finished the 1999 Challenge ranged in age from 19 (Drew Shaub, of
Glenshaw) to 63 (John DeWalt) and the women from 16 (Megan Rogers of Allison
Park) to 68 (Sally Martin, 68, of Bradford Woods, finished at Harrison Hills at
8:20 PM-talk about getting better and better). In total, 13 women and 61 men
finished the entire &quot;34 miles in one day&quot;. Not bad, not bad at all.</p>
