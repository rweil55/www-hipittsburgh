    <p align="justify"></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Whitewater 
    rivers contain </font><font face="Times New Roman">many hazards</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"> which are not always easily recognized. The 
    following are the most frequent killers.</font><font size="2"></p></font></b></li></ol><b><font size="2">
  <blockquote></font></b>
    <ol type="A">
      <li><strong>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">HIGH 
      WATER.</font></strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"> The river's 
      speed and power increase tremendously as the flow increases, raising the 
      difficulty of most rapids. Rescue becomes progressively harder as the 
      water rises, adding to the danger. Floating debris and strainers make even 
      an easy rapid quite hazardous. It is often misleading to judge the river 
      level at the put in, since a small rise in a wide, shallow place will be 
      multiplied many times where the river narrows. Use reliable gauge 
      information whenever possible, and be aware that sun on snowpack, hard 
      rain, and upstream dam releases may greatly increase the flow.</font><font size="2"></p></font>
      <li><strong>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">COLD.</font></strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"> Cold drains your strength and robs you of 
      the ability to make sound decisions on matters affecting your survival. 
      Cold water immersion, because of the initial shock and the rapid heat loss 
      which follows, is especially dangerous. Dress appropriately for bad 
      weather or sudden immersion in the water. When the water temperature is 
      less than 50 degree F., a wetsuit or drysuit is essential for protection 
      if you swim. Next best is wool or pile clothing under a waterproof shell. 
      In this case, you should also carry waterproof matches and a change of 
      clothing in a waterproof bag. If, after prolonged exposure, a person 
      experiences uncontrollable shaking, loss of coordination, or difficulty 
      speaking, he or she is hypothermic, and needs your assistance.</font><font size="2"></p></font>
      <li><strong>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">STRAINERS.</font></strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"> Brush, fallen trees, bridge pilings, 
      undercut rocks or anything else which allows river current to sweep 
      through can pin boats and boaters against the obstacle. Water pressure on 
      anything trapped this way can be overwhelming. Rescue is often extremely 
      difficult. Pinning may occur in fast current, with little or not 
      whitewater to warn of the danger.</font><font size="2"></p></font>
      <li><strong>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">DAMS, WIERS, LEDGES, 
      REVERSALS, HOLES, AND HYDRAULICS</strong><font size="2">. When water drops 
      over a obstacle, it curls back on itself, forming a strong upstream 
      current which may be capable of holding a boat or swimmer. Some holes make 
      for excellent sport. Others are proven killers. </font>Paddlers who cannot 
      recognize the difference should avoid all but the smallest holes.<font size="2"> Hydraulics around man-made dams must be treated with utmost 
      respect regardless of their height or the level of the river. Despite 
      their seemingly benign appearance, they can create an almost escape-proof 
      trap. The swimmers </font>only exit</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"> from the &quot;drowning machine&quot; is to dive below the surface when the 
      downstream current is flowing beneath the reversal.</font><font size="2"></p></font>
      <li><strong>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">BROACHING.</font></strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"> When a boat is pushed sideways against a 
      rock by strong current, it may collapse and wrap. This is especially 
      dangerous to kayak and decked canoe paddlers; these boats will collapse 
      and the combination of indestructible hulls and tight outfitting may 
      create a deadly trap. Even without entrapment, releasing pinned boats can 
      be extremely time-consuming and dangerous. To avoid pinning, throw your 
      weight downstream towards the rock. This allows the current to slide 
      harmlessly underneath the hull. </font><font size="2"></p></font></li></ol><font size="2"></blockquote></font>

    guidebooks, if available, should be examined. The group should secure 
    accurate flow information; the more difficult the run, the more important 
    this will be. Be aware of possible changes in river level and how this will

    increasing responsibility for his or her own safety, in accordance with what 
    he or she knows or should know as a result of that increased experience. 
    Also, as in all trip formats, every participant must realize and assume the

  easily into one category, and regional or individual interpretations may cause 
  misunderstandings. It is no substitute for a guidebook or accurate first-hand 
  descriptions of a run.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Paddlers

  may change each year due to fluctuations in water level, downed trees, recent 
  floods, geological disturbances, or bad weather. </font><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Stay alert for unexpected 
  problems!</font></p></strong><font size="2">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">As river difficulty increases, 
  the danger to swimming paddlers becomes more severe. As rapids become longer 
  and more continuous, the challenge increases. There is a difference between 
  running an occasional Class IV rapid and dealing with an entire river of this 
  category. Allow an extra margin of safety between skills and river ratings

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Class I: 
Easy.</font></strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"> Fast moving water with 
riffles and small waves. Few obstructions, all obvious and easily missed with 
little training. Risk to swimmers is slight; self-rescue is easy.</font><font size="2"></p></font><strong>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Class II: 
Novice.</font></strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"> Straightforward 
rapids with wide, clear channels which are evident without scouting. Occasional 
maneuvering may be required, but rocks and medium sized waves are easily missed 
by trained paddlers. Swimmers are seldom injured and group assistance, while 
helpful, is seldom needed. Rapids that are at the upper end of this difficulty 
range are designated &quot;Class II+&quot;.</font><font size="2"></p></font><strong>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Class III: 
Intermediate.</font></strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"> Rapids with 
moderate, irregular waves which may be difficult to avoid and which can swamp an 
open canoe. Complex maneuvers in fast current and good boat control in tight 
passages or around ledges are often required; large waves or strainers may be 
present but are easily avoided. Strong eddies and powerful current effects can 
be found, particularly on large-volume rivers. Scouting is advisable for 
inexperienced parties. Injuries while swimming are rare; self-rescue is usually 
easy but group assistance may be required to avoid long swims. Rapids that are 
at the lower or upper end of this difficulty range are designated &quot;Class III-&quot; 
or &quot;Class III+&quot; respectively.</font><font size="2"></p></font><strong>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Class IV: 
Advanced.</font></strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"> Intense, powerful 
but predictable rapids requiring precise boat handling in turbulent water. 
Depending on the character of the river, it may feature large, unavoidable waves 
and holes or constricted passages demanding fast maneuvers under pressure. A 
fast, reliable eddy turn may be needed to initiate maneuvers, scout rapids, or 
rest. Rapids may require "must'' moves above dangerous hazards. Scouting may be 
necessary the first time down. Risk of injury to swimmers is moderate to high, 
and water conditions may make self-rescue difficult. Group assistance for rescue 
is often essential but requires practiced skills. A strong Eskimo roll is highly 
recommended. Rapids that are at the upper end of this difficulty range are 
designated &quot;Class IV-&quot; or &quot;Class IV+&quot; respectively.</font><font size="2"></p></font><strong>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Class 5: Expert. Extremely long, 
obstructed, or very violent rapids which expose a paddler to added risk. Drops 
may contain</font></strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"> large, 
unavoidable waves and holes or steep, congested chutes with complex, demanding 
routes. Rapids may continue for long distances between pools, demanding a high 
level of fitness. What eddies exist may be small, turbulent, or difficult to 
reach. At the high end of the scale, several of these factors may be combined. 
Scouting is Recommended but may be difficult. Swims are dangerous, and rescue is 
often difficult even for experts. A very reliable Eskimo roll, proper equipment, 
extensive experience, and practiced rescue skills are essential. Because of the 
large range of difficulty that exists beyond class IV, Class 5 is an open ended, 
multiple level scale designated by Class 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, etc... Each of these 
levels is an order of magnitude more difficult than the last. Example: 
Increasing difficulty from class 5.0 to class 5.1 is a similar order of 
magnitude as increasing from class IV to Class 5.0. </font><font size="2"></p></font><strong>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Class VI: Extreme and 
Exploratory.</font></strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"> These runs have 
almost never been attempted and often exemplify the extremes of difficulty, 
unpredictability and danger. The consequences of errors are very severe and 
rescue may be impossible. For teams of experts only, at favorable water levels, 
after close personal inspection and taking all precautions. After a Class VI 
rapids has been run many times, It's rating may be changed to an appropriate Class 5.x rating.</font><font size="2"></p></font>
