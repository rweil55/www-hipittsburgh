<h3>
The AYH Sailing Fleet</h3>
The Pittsburgh Council fleet includes Flying Juniors, Sunfish, and an International
470. Several members also use their own sailboats. Most of our day sailing
trips and classes will be on Lake Arthur in <a href="http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/parks/morain.htm">Moraine
State Park</a> near Butler, Pennsylvania. We often participate in activities
and races with the Moraine Sailing Club. Additional weekend trips and extended
trips were also planned.

<h3>
Trip Requirements</h3>
Most trips require previous sailing experience. This generally means a
minimum of a Red Cross certified Basic Sailing Class or equivalent. Participants
for all sailing activities must be in good physical condition and be able
to pass minimum Red Cross recommendations for swimming competency. Personal
Floatation Devices were required on all trips. Individuals with their own
sailboats were encouraged to join our program. We also need individuals
with trailer hitches to pull the sailboat trailers.
<p>Day sail trip fees were $14 per person per day ($16 for non-members).
Racing in the International 470 was open to members only, with a day fee
of $20.<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_private/plugnewsletter.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->
