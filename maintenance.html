<h2 ALIGN="left">1997 Trail Maintenance Annual Planning Meeting</h2>

<h3 ALIGN="left">Crooked Creek Environmental Learning Center,&nbsp; March 1, 1997</h3>

<p>The first-ever, Annual Meeting of the AYH trail maintainers took place
on March 1, at the Crooked Creek Environmental Learning Center. In spite
of the &quot;mixed-bag&quot; weather, warm but on the verge of rain all
day, twenty trail people (21 counting Shane Hummell) participated in the
meeting. Trail people tend often to be private types, keeping to themselves
out in the woods, or at least that is the stereotype, so 20 was a good
number. This was the first time many of these maintainers have met their
own kind face-to-face, so it was a good experience.</p>

<p>The agenda included personal introductions, a review of trail activity
during last year, 1996, and a look at the objectives for 1997. The discussion
of objectives revealed the Gerry Vaerewyck can solve about half of our
problems single-handedly. I thank Gerry for coming and offering his assistance
and &quot;we will be in touch&quot;. A couple of new volunteers showed
up, Steve Theiss, from Sharon, PA and Chuck and Sally Martin, from Pittsburgh.
Steve just wants to get involved and Chuck and Sally want to adopt a section
of the Rachel Carson and promote an extension of the trail to the Harmony
Trail in the North Hills. </p>

<p>As a matter of information, it was noted that 66 individuals participated
in AYH Trail Maintenance last year, contributing 851 hours of labor (not
including travel time to and from the work sites). There are 18 open slots
on the Baker Trail, out of a total of 29, and there are 6 open slots on
the Rachel Carson Trail, out of a total of 16. So, if you have an interest
in taking care of your own section of the Baker or Rachel Carson Trails,
give Jim Ritchie a call at 412-828-0210. </p>

<p>After the formal meeting, a short hike down to the two new bridges constructed
last year by Walter Teresciewicz and installed with help from Patti Scheuering,
Bob Roth, and Brian Koehler, gave us all a chance to stretch our muscles
a little. We were also able to see the old gondola cable used by Apollo
Gas Company to cross Crooked Creek; we are considering the use of this
structure to replace the now-defunct cable bridge at Cherry Run, a pet
project of Vince Roolf. </p>

<p>Soon it will be time to get on the old clothes, open up the can of paint
and get out there and put on the 1997 coat of paint. It was emphasized
at the meeting, the blazes make the trail a trail and that is why it is
so important to get the blazing done each year. Watch the AYH Golden Triangle
over the next 6 months for a variety of &quot;maintenance hikes&quot; you
can sign up for, including a couple of weekend camp-out projects.</p>
