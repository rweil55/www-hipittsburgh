<p><b><font size="5">Hostels</font></b> are friendly, inexpensive lodgings for
travelers. They provide dormitory-style accommodations with separate quarters
for males and females. Many hostels have private/family rooms which can be
reserved in advance. Beds come with blankets and pillow; hostel guests provide
(or rent for a modest fee) their own towels and bed linens.&nbsp; The Pittsburgh
International Hostel charged $19 for members, and $22 for non-members, including
tax /night/bed.
