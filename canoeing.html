Canoeing</h2>
Pittsburgh Council had a very active <a href="canoeing.html#CANOEING_PROGRAM">Canoeing </a><a href="canoeing.html#CANOEING_PROGRAM">Program</a><a href="canoeing.html#CANOEING_PROGRAM">.</a>
We lead many <a href="canoeing.html#CANOE_SCHOOLS">Canoeing Schools</a>. Most trips were for
the beginner to intermediate canoeist. i.e. Class I to Class III on the <a href="safety/default.htm#Rating Scale">
International Scale of River Difficulty</a>.&nbsp; We rely heavily on the
Army Corps of Engineers <a href="http://wmw.lrp.usace.army.mil/current/">River
and Reservoir Gauge Readings</a>

 to determine where a trip will be going on any particular day.&nbsp; All trips
were lead with the AWA <a href="http://www.awa.org/awa/safety/safety.html">Safety
Code</a>  in mind.
<h3>
<a NAME="CANOEING_PROGRAM"></a>Pittsburgh AYH Canoeing Program</h3>
Pittsburgh Council offers a variety of canoeing activities during the canoeing
season from May to October. These vary in difficulty from family trips
on quiet rivers to Class III whitewater. Trips may be day trips or canoe-camping
trips several days in length or longer. To participate in canoe trips,
you must demonstrate to the trip leader that you were qualified at the level
of the trip by having taken one of our canoe schools or having equivalent
experience.<p>Pittsburgh Council runs several canoe schools to allow new members to
get started in canoeing or to improve their skills. You may choose to develop
your skills as a solo or tandem paddler. The number of schools and types
of trips each month reflect the wishes of the membership and trip leaders.
<p>Most of our leaders and instructors were developed through the AYH canoeing
program. New members with previous experience were usually asked to attend
a whitewater school to see how Council trips were run.
<p>Pittsburgh Council has canoes, life vests, and paddles for use on Council
trips at a modest rental fee. While Council policy prevents the equipment
from being used on higher class rivers, some members paddle their own canoes
on more difficult water.<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_private/plugnewsletter.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Check the latest <a href="newsletter/index.htm">newsletter</a> for the current trip
schedule and leader. Call the leader listed for information about a trip or to
sign up for the trip.&nbsp; Please call before 10 o'clock at night.

<h3><a NAME="CANOE_SCHOOLS"></a>
 Pittsburgh AYH Canoe Schools</h3>
<b>Basic Canoeing</b> introduces canoeing on flat and moving water. Steering
and maneuvering strokes were taught along with the proper method of getting
into and out of a canoe, and how to load, unload, lift, and carry a canoe.
<p><b>Whitewater I</b> (WW I) reviews the basic strokes used on whitewater
rivers. These were taught on still or quiet water. Progress to moving water
follows, and downstream and upstream ferrying skills were taught and practiced.
Other skills that were taught include river reading, safety, rescue, river
etiquette, and scouting procedures. The school was taught on Class I rivers.
<p><b>Whitewater II</b> (WW II) reviews the skills learned in WW I and
moves on to eddy turns, peel outs, surfing, rescue, safety, and tactics
for river running. WW II was taught on Class II rivers.
<p><b>Poling</b> was taught on flowing streams. This is an interesting variation
to the sport, and not nearly as difficult as it may seem.
