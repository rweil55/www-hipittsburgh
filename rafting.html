<h2>
 Rafting</h2>
<p>Rafting trips require participants to help in transporting the gear
from the hostel to the river and back, pumping up and deflating the rafts,
drying out the equipment, and providing for its proper storage at the Council's
activities building. All rafters will be required to wear rafting helmets
and approved life vests while on the river. The Council owns two 6-person
rafts and two 4-person rafts, paddles, life jackets, and a limited number
of helmets. All rafters were expected to bring lunch and beverage in waterproof
and break proof containers, a change of dry clothes (especially a pair of
river shoes with thick soles), sun tan lotion, and wool jacket/sweater
for cold wet days where hypothermia would be a concern. Also, rafters will
be expected to pay a rental fee, a river shuttle fee, and share transportation
expenses to and from the river. Would-be trippers should call the volunteer
trip leaders listed below to get specific details on the trip they wish
to join or to make reservations.<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_private/plugnewsletter.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->
<!-- rrwbegnewsplug -->

<p>Check the latest <a href="newsletter/index.htm">newsletter</a> for the current trip
schedule and leader. Call the leader listed for information about a trip or to
sign up for the trip.&nbsp; Please call before 10 o'clock at night.
