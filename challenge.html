<h2 ALIGN="left"> Rachel Carson Trail Challenge Explained</h2>

<p><br>
The Rachel Carson Trail Challenge is a 34-mile, one-day, endurance
hiking event, held in the spirit of the Alaskan Iditarod, the Boston Marathon,
the 70-mile Laurel Highlands Trail Run, and the various Ironman Triathlons
held around the country each year. Sponsored by the Pittsburgh Council,
American Youth Hostels, starts at the crack of dawn, and will
extend through the 34-mile roller coaster of hills and bluffs between North
Park and Harrison Hills in Allegheny County, ending as the sun sets under
the horizon. The &quot;Challenge&quot; is to endure, to finish the hike
in one day, rather than to &quot;come in first&quot; or &quot;win&quot;
the hike. </p>

<p>The Rachel Carson Trail stretches from North Park, in Shaler, to Harrison
Hills County Park, lying entirely within Allegheny County. The trail is
characterized by its roller coaster hills and is often said to be one of
the most difficult hiking trails in the United States. A typical hiking
pace is 2 miles per hour. The hike will begin at sunrise and will officially
end at sunset, 5:50 A.M. to 8:54 P.M., a total of 15 hours and 4 minutes.
</p>

<p>The Challenge consists of two dimensions: the first challenge is to
endure 34 miles of tortuous hill-climbing and descent in whatever weather
conditions we are dealt; the second, more subtle, is your ability to keep
on the route. Obviously, those who have hiked the trail before will have
some advantage in maintaining the proper route. </p>

<p>The endurance hiker participants will be given a trip sheet and a set
of topographic maps to guide them on their journey. There will be a half
dozen checkpoints throughout the hike, offering minimal support. Hikers
are expected to carry all their own gear and necessities, including food,
water, and snacks, first aid equipment, raingear, maps and a trip sheet.
</p>

<p>The Rachel Carson Trail is an &quot;undeveloped&quot; trail in the sense
that no special grading or surfacing materials are used on the trail. It
is a typical Western Pennsylvania hiking trail and hikers should expect
to find all the conditions a typical hiker would encounter on a typical
hiking trail. While the trail is blazed with yellow paint blazes, there
will be an occasional missing blaze where a tree has fallen or you are
following a logging road or a power line or gas line; there will be blowdowns,
washouts, poison ivy, nettles, bugs, loose gravel and rocks, steep inclines,
and wet stream crossings. You must even be prepared to expect the unexpected.
The better hiker you are, the better you will do on the Challenge. </p>
