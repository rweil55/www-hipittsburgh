<font face="Arial"><font color="#00CC00">Everything You Need to Know about
Visiting&nbsp;<br>
the former Pittsburgh International Hostel on Warrington</font></font></h1>

<h3>
<b><i><font face="Arial">Dear Hosteller:</font></i></b></h3>
Thank you for inquiring about former  Pittsburgh International
Hostel. We have put together this fact sheet that we hope will answer most
of your questions prior to arrival. If you still have questions after you&#146;ve
read this, please let us know!
<h3>
<b>What Is A Hostel?</b></h3>
The spirit of hostelling is to get out and explore the world. Hostels are
comfortable, environmentally sensitive places for budget-minded independent
travelers to lodge for the night and provide dormitory-style accommodations,
women in one room, men in the other. (See below for information about private/family
rooms). Bathroom facilities are provided in each dorm, as are lockers.
Meet people from all over the world when using the common area, do-it-yourself
kitchen and dining room. Just like at home, hostellers clean up after themselves.
With everyone pitching in, the place is spotless in no time and the hostel
can keep the overnight charge as low as possible. Hostels provide the bed,
pillow and blanket &#150; you bring your own sheets, pillowcase, locks and towels,
or rent them upon arrival.
<h3><b>Location:</b></h3>
The hostel was conveniently located in the Allentown area of Pittsburgh
two miles south of downtown above the <a href="http://www.betatesters.com/penn/sahside/">historic
Southside</a> between Mt. Oliver and Mt. Washington. See <a href="#DIRECTIONS">below</a>
for directions.
<h3>
<b>Hours</b>:</h3>
For 2000, Hostel Hours were: 0800-1000 and 1700-2200. The
former Pittsburgh International Hostel on Warrington  was NOT a 24-hour-a-day facility.
<p>The hostel was closed every year for the nights of December 23<sup>rd</sup>
through December 26<sup>th</sup> for Christmas.
<p>We were closed during the day. That&#146;s when you get to explore Pittsburgh!
Guests return to the hostel after 5 p.m. Lockers and visitor information
were available when the hostel was closed.
<p>All guests must check-in <i><u>no later than</u></i> 2200 (10 p.m.).
Sorry no exceptions.
<h3>
<b>Facilities:</b></h3>
The 50-bed hostel was located in a renovated 19<sup>th</sup> century bank
building, complete with 8-ton vault door (now the entrance to our elevator).
The building was fully handicapped accessible. Women and men were accommodated
in separate spacious dormitory-style rooms with bathroom facilities located
in each. A limited number of family rooms were available (see below). The
top floor of the hostel contains: a fabulous kitchen that inspires cooks
and conversation, a dining room seating 25-30, two common rooms, and a
conference/class room with a TV and VCR. We also provide free parking on
our lot just up the street from the hostel.
<h3>
<b>Prices:</b></h3>
For individual guests in dormitory-style accommodation. (All prices include
tax.)

<ul>
<li>
Hostelling International members: $17.00/person/night.</li>

<li>
Non-members may stay for an additional $3.00/night.</li>

<li>
Memberships were available on the spot.</li>

<li>

<h3>
<b>Supervision policies regarding children:</b></h3>

<li>
Infants &#150; 4 years: family room only in consideration of our other guests</li>

<li>

<li>
Call before arrival to confirm availability of family rooms (for which
a surcharge applies), if appropriate.</li>

<li>
<i>All children under 18 must have an adult chaperone of the appropriate
gender.</i></li>

<h3>
<b>Family Rooms:</b></h3>
A limited number of private/family rooms were available. Reservations were
essential for family rooms (especially for Friday and Saturday nights).
A surcharge of $10.00/night applies <i>in addition</i> to member/non-member/child
rates (see above) and includes, in addition to the private room, all linen
and a semi-private bathroom across the hall.
<p>NOTE: Minimum charge and key deposit apply to family rooms. $50 <u>minimum</u>
for family rooms containing one double bed and one set of bunks. <i>Final
price may be higher than these minimum charges and was based on member/non-member/child
rates plus the nightly surcharge.</i> Check availability of these rooms
for the nights you need by contacting the hostel.
<h3>
<b>Groups:</b></h3>
Hostels are great for groups of all kinds! Scout and school groups, family
reunions, overflow accommodation when it&#146;s full at your place! Groups consist
of 10 or more people arriving together and are welcomed with advanced reservations.
Please inquire about our discounted group rate. We prefer that groups contact
us <i>no less than one month in advance</i> to ensure bed availability.
Due to the layout of our building, normally only 15 people of each gender
can be accommodated within a group. Meals (breakfast and/or lunch) can
be arranged for groups with advanced notice and for a small additional
charge per person. Please ask for our Group Inquiry Packet.
<h3>
<b>Day Use:</b></h3>
Rental of the hostel during the day when the hostel was closed was available
for meetings, conferences, receptions, classes, family reunions, etc.,
(with or without overnight accommodation). Please contact the hostel for
details, availability and pricing. Affordable for-profit and non-profit
day use rates make the hostel an ideal place to hold your event while supporting
Hostelling International (a non-profit organization). Please ask for our
Day Use Agreement.
<h3>
<b>Additional Information:</b></h3>
Don&#146;t forget to bring your membership card! The membership rate was available
only upon presentation of a valid Hostelling International membership card
at check-in.
<p>Because hostels are intended for travelers and are not permanent housing,
we have a length of stay limit.
<p>Government-issued photo ID required to check-in: Passport, driver&#146;s
license, state or military ID.
<p>Sleeping bags were NOT allowed in our hostel for sanitary reasons.
<p>Each bed was supplied with a pillow and blanket. You provide the linen,
either by bringing your own or renting it from us for a small charge ($1.00
for sleep sacks, $.50 for towels)
<p>We have a 24-hour cancellation policy. Your credit card will be billed
for the first night&#146;s deposit if you fail to cancel your reservation by
10 p.m. the night <i>before </i>your intended arrival date.
